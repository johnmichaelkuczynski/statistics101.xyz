            All interactive controls (buttons, inputs, dialogs, menus) are
            built on Radix UI primitives, which provide ARIA semantics out
            of the box.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pages use semantic HTML (<code>&lt;header&gt;</code>,{" "}
            <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>,{" "}

            Color contrast meets or exceeds 4.5:1 for body text and 3:1 for
            large text and UI components.

            The site is fully keyboard navigable. Focus rings are visible
            on all interactive elements.

          Every assignment in this course uses a two-box workflow: a{" "}
          <strong>Draft Workshop</strong> (where pasting and AI feedback
          are allowed) and a <strong>Submission Canvas</strong> (where
          your final answer is composed). Before you can submit, please
          understand:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc space-y-1 pl-5">
          <li>
            Submissions are typed into a <strong>monitored canvas</strong>.
            Pasting from outside the canvas is disabled. You can still cut,
            copy, and rearrange text you typed yourself.
          </li>
          <li>
            Typing patterns and the final submitted text are analyzed by{" "}
            <strong>GPTZero</strong>. A traffic-light bar shows you the
            current AI-likelihood score in real time.
          </li>
          <li>
            Submissions flagged as likely AI-generated are reviewed by
            your instructor. You may always submit; flagged work is not
            blocked, but the flag is sent to the instructor with your
            submission.
          </li>
          <li>
            The complete <strong>keystroke history</strong> of every
            submission is logged, along with the live score history and an
            automated activity report. Your instructor can replay how the
            submission was composed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Students with documented accommodations may have monitoring
